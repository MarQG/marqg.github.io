Now at Version 4 of React Router

Whats New?

Two Pieces:
React-router-dom
React-router-native

Old way Nested Routes in the Router

HashRouter for Static Websites examples Netlify, Github Pages, testing

BrowserRouter for Dynamic Sites with a server that handles dynamic requests

Both work the same way
Both use similar syntax

Setup Routes with HashRouter 
```
<HashRouter>
	<Switch>
		<Route exact path=“/” component={ComponentName} />
		<Route component={ComponentName} /> ## Fallback Route
	</Switch>
</HashRouter>
```

exact helps us define the parent route of the other routes
Use exact when a parent router has children routes


How does react know to display the routes if we don’t supply a route . As long as we supply the root route it will display that route.

You can supply  { location } as a prop in a component to access location in the component.

There are special setups for using React-Router with Redux

You don’t have to use react-router to route. There are other methods to use.

PageTemplate will render a template and pass in {children}  to render the children in that component and render it inside the PageTemplate component. This is how to handle nested navigation with react-router

```
const PageTemplate = ({ children }) => 
	<div className="page">
		<MainMenu />
		{ children }
	</div>

export const Vans = () => 
	<PageTemplate>
		## This will setup the sub routes for Vans
		<Router path="/star-wars" component={StarWars} />
		<Router path="/horse" component={Horse} />
		<Router path="/snake-and-wolf" component={SnakeAndWolf} />
	</PageTemplate>
```
